# Rate Limiting

`boxExpressRateLimit()` — fixed-window rate limiting, keyed by `req.ip` by default.

## Usage

Fixed-window rate limiting, mirroring the npm [express-rate-limit](https://github.com/express-rate-limit/express-rate-limit) package's most commonly used options:

```bxs
app.use( boxExpressRateLimit() )                                     // 100 req/min per req.ip
app.use( "/login", boxExpressRateLimit( { windowMs: 15 * 60000, max: 5 } ) )  // 5 req/15min, scoped to one route
```

Sets the draft-standard `RateLimit-Limit`/`RateLimit-Remaining`/`RateLimit-Reset` headers (disable with `{ standardHeaders: false }`), and responds `429` with `Retry-After` once a key's count exceeds `max` within `windowMs`. Fixed window, not a sliding one or a token bucket — a client can get up to 2x `max` requests through right at a window boundary, the same trade-off most minimal in-memory rate limiters make in exchange for O(1) bookkeeping per request.

## Options

```bxs
app.use( boxExpressRateLimit( {
    windowMs: 60000,                              // 1 minute window
    max: 20,                                      // 20 requests per window per key
    keyGenerator: ( req ) => req.session.userId ?: req.ip,  // key on something other than IP
    message: { error: true, message: "Slow down." }
} ) )
```

The default key is `req.ip`, so the same caveat as `req.ip` itself applies: behind a reverse proxy without `app.set( "trust proxy", 1 )` (or a list of the proxies' addresses), every request shares the proxy's own IP as the key, rate-limiting the whole app together rather than per client. See [Configuration](/projects/boxlang-express/docs/config#app-level-settings).

## Sharing the count across instances

By default the store is in-memory on each `RateLimit` instance (same trade-off as `Session`'s default `MemoryStore` — fine for a single-process app, not a cluster). To share the count across instances, name a registered BoxLang cache:

```bxs
app.use( "/login", boxExpressRateLimit( { max: 5, windowMs: 15 * 60000, cache: "shared" } ) )
```

`cache` takes the same `fallback`/`requireDurable` options and degrades the same way as durable sessions (see [Falling back without durable storage](/projects/boxlang-express/docs/sessions#falling-back-without-durable-storage)): with no durable cache it counts per process, with a warning, and never fails the request. `store: myStore` — any object with `hit( key, windowMs )` returning `{ count, resetAt }` — plugs in your own.

The read-then-write against the cache isn't atomic, so under heavy concurrency a limit can run a few requests over, never far under. Every request also costs a cache round trip — a database call for a `JDBCStore` — so use it on routes that matter (login, signup) rather than as a blanket limit.

## Independent limits per route

Each call creates its own counters, so different routes can have independent limits:

```bxs
app.post(
    "/upload",
    boxExpressRateLimit( { windowMs: 5 * 60000, max: 10 } ),
    boxExpressUpload( { dest: expandPath( "./uploads" ) } ),
    ( req, res ) => { /* ... */ }
)
```
